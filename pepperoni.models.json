Needless to say, it has left its indelible mark on the culture of Europe. In comparison to how coffee is consumed in the United States, Europe still knows how to savor it. It is not a continent that takes kindly to pouring fresh brew into a Styrofoam or paper cup. For Europe, it is not merely about the product, that is the beverage. It is about an experience. We will see that it is every bit as much about the coffee house itself as it is about how the coffee is brewed and consumed. Many European coffee cultures, especially those of Western Europe (Spain, Portugal, France) are extremely similar. If we were to go in-depth in describing all of the intricacies of each European country's coffee culture, you’d be reading for hours. Today we will discuss the big players and influencers."

Secondo alcuni entrambe le opere risalgono a un periodo vicino, dopo il ritorno del pittore da Roma per affrescare alcune scene nella cappella Sistina (1482) o immediatamente prima del viaggio (1478 per Crowe e Cavalcaselle). Secondo altri la Primavera sarebbe stata dipinta prima e la Nascita di Venere dopo il viaggio. La Yashiro indicò il 1487, Salvini il 1484; la critica moderna propende oggi invece per il 1486. Esistono alcune repliche di bottega del soggetto, databili entro la fine del secolo. Di queste repliche ne sono sopravvissute tre: una conservata alla Gemäldegalerie di Berlino, un'altra alla Galleria Sabauda di Torino e la terza che si trova in una collezione privata a Ginevra. Nel corso dei secoli questo dipinto è diventato una delle icone della cultura italiana universalmente conosciute. Anche grazie a questo, un particolare della Nascita di Venere (il volto della dea) è utilizzato nella moneta euro italiana del valore di dieci centesimi."

The use of volunteers had a precedent in the Iberian munus of Scipio Africanus; but none of those had been paid. For the poor, and for non-citizens, enrollment in a gladiator school offered a trade, regular food, housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune. Mark Antony chose a troupe of gladiators to be his personal bodyguard. Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received, and these could be substantial. Tiberius offered several retired gladiators 100000 sesterces each to return to the arena. Nero gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence \"equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs.\""

I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'\" So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. And while they were eating, he said, \"Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.\" They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, \"Surely you don't mean me, Lord?\" Jesus replied, \"The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, \"Surely you don't mean me, Rabbi?\" Jesus answered, \"You have said so.\" While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take and eat; this is my body.\" Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, \"Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.\" When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. - Matthew 26:17-30 NIV."

Cette première «université» se dote de règlements et de statuts propres, se structure en quatre facultés (arts libéraux, droit, médecine et théologie) et, si elle ne dispose alors pas véritablement de bâtiments propres, s’enracine sur la rive gauche de la Seine. Afin d’accueillir les étudiants qui affluent de toute l’Europe et se regroupent en «nations», de nombreux collèges sont créés sur les flancs de la Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. Celui fondé par le maître en théologie Robert de Sorbon, reconnu par le pouvoir royal en 1257, devient la principale implantation de la Faculté de théologie. Le collège de «Sorbonne» acquiert une renommée considérable, contribuant au rayonnement européen de l’Université de Paris. Les lieux d’enseignement liés aux différentes autres facultés sont dispersés dans le même quartier, au gré de la multiplication des collèges, mouvement continu jusqu’au XVIIe siècle, où sont créés bibliothèques et salles de cours magistraux. Le XVIIe siècle marque une étape importante dans l’histoire matérielle de la Sorbonne: devenu proviseur du collège de Sorbonne en 1622, le cardinal de Richelieu charge l’architecte Jacques Lemercier de rénover et de réunir l’ensemble des bâtiments disparates qui composaient alors le collège. Une chapelle à coupole d’inspiration baroque (1635-1642) est notamment créée au cœur de la Sorbonne rénovée. Si, dans la deuxième moitié du XVIIIe siècle, l’Université établit son siège dans les locaux du collège Louis-le-Grand laissés inoccupés par l’expulsion des Jésuites en 1762, aucun projet d’ampleur ne vient encore révolutionner la place qu’occupent les différentes facultés dans le quartier Latin."

The other church on the hill, Saint Pierre de Montmartre, built in 1147, was the church of the prestigious Montmartre Abbey. On 15 August 1534, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, Saint Francis Xavier and five other companions bound themselves by vows in the Martyrium of Saint Denis, 11 Rue Yvonne Le Tac, the first step in the creation of the Jesuits. Near the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th, during the Belle Époque, many artists lived, worked, or had studios in or around Montmartre, including Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Suzanne Valadon, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso, Camille Pissarro and Vincent van Gogh.

Many centuries ago, on these gigantic rocks with the breathtaking landscape reaching heights of more than 600 meters, it was formed one of the most important monastic communities of Greece. The Greek word Meteora means “suspended in the air” and this phrase aptly describes these remarkable Greek Orthodox monasteries. Meteora is a great place to experience , a spectacular landscape and byzantine monasteries perched on top of steep rocks that house priceless artifacts and wall paintings. Today only six monasteries are active with a small number of monks or nuns who reside on Meteora. In 1988, the Meteora monasteries have been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and the Meteora-Antichassia area is part of the Natura 2000 network hosting some rare species of birds and flowers. As you approach the town of Kalabaka, the nearest big town near Meteora , and the picturesque village of Kastraki you will see a complex of giant sandstone rock pillars that climb up into the sky.

Other notable civilizations that appeared somewhat later are the Hittites and other Anatolian peoples, the Phoenicians, and Mycenean Greece. Around 1200 BC the eastern Mediterranean was greatly affected by the Bronze Age Collapse, which resulted in the destruction of many cities and trade routes. The most notable Mediterranean civilizations in classical antiquity were the Greek city states and the Phoenicians, both of which extensively colonized the coastlines of the Mediterranean."
